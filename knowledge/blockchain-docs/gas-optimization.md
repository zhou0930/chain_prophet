# Gas Optimization Guide

## Understanding Gas

Gas is the unit of computation on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains. It measures the computational effort required to execute operations.

### Gas Components
- **Base Fee**: Dynamic fee that adjusts based on network congestion
- **Priority Fee (Tip)**: Additional fee to incentivize miners/validators
- **Gas Limit**: Maximum gas units a transaction can consume

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Timing Transactions
- Execute during low-activity periods (typically 2-6 AM UTC)
- Monitor gas price trends using tools like GasNow or Etherscan
- Use gas price alerts to catch optimal timing

### 2. Gas Price Settings
- **Standard**: 1.1x current base fee
- **Fast**: 1.2x current base fee  
- **Instant**: 1.5x+ current base fee

### 3. Transaction Batching
- Combine multiple operations into single transaction
- Use smart contracts for complex multi-step operations
- Consider Layer 2 solutions for frequent operations

### 4. Network Selection
- Use Layer 2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon) for lower fees
- Consider alternative chains for specific use cases
- Evaluate cross-chain bridge costs vs. direct transactions
