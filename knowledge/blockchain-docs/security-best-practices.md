# Blockchain Security Best Practices

## Wallet Security

### Private Key Management
- **Hardware Wallets**: Use Ledger, Trezor for large amounts

### Transaction Security
- **Address Verification**: Always double-check recipient addresses
- **Amount Confirmation**: Verify transaction amounts before signing
- **Network Validation**: Ensure correct network selection
- **Gas Limit Review**: Set appropriate gas limits to prevent failures

## Smart Contract Security

### Before Interacting
- **Contract Verification**: Check if contract is verified on block explorer
- **Code Review**: Examine contract source code when available
- **Audit Reports**: Look for professional security audits
- **Community Reputation**: Research project history and community feedback

### Risk Assessment
- **Rug Pull Risk**: Evaluate tokenomics and team credibility
- **Liquidity Risk**: Check trading volume and liquidity depth

- **Regulatory Risk**: Consider compliance and legal implications

## Common Attack Vectors

### Phishing Attacks

- **Social Engineering**: Be wary of unsolicited messages
- **Fake Apps**: Download wallets only from official sources
- **Email Scams**: Never click suspicious links

### Technical Vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy**: Contracts calling external contracts before state updates
- **Integer Overflow**: Arithmetic operations exceeding data type limits
- **Access Control**: Improper permission management
